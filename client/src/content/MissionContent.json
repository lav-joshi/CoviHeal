  "text": "The healthcare sector is at the epicenter of this unprecedented global pandemic challenge, plasma therapy has come as a saviour for the affected but finding plasma  has became a challenge of its own, due to the lack of a unified platform which links the data of all the donors in a geographic area and helps to overpass the hustle of finding a donor with who has recovered at a certain point of time and holds a compatible blood group.Thus as a counter to that we present to you CoviHeal a two-way system between a patient and plasma donor."
